UndeadSiege is a mod that changes and replaces normal zombie sieges with configurable sieges. Since most of the siege editing mod are outdated, i have decided to make one my self.

 

Vanilla sieges are disabled, and now running there is the mod version of the siege. Those can be configurable with the included command "siegeconfig <probabilty> <zombies> <equipment>" where:

- probabilty is the probabilty in % to summon a siege in a village at midnight.Must be between 10 and 100.
- zombies is the averange number of zombies in a siege.
- equipment is a boolean value and when it's set to true the zombies will spawn with iron equipment.
- When the equipment variable is true, Zombies will spawn with equipment based on world Difficulty.

The chances are the same as vanilla.

 

Feel free to make your modpack with this mod!
